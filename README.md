# LSTM-time-series-forecasting-COVID-19

Being effective in learning from long-term dependencies, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are well-suited for time series analysis and forecasting future data based on historical data. This research project focuses on predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Canary Islands through historical time-stamped data on hospitalized cases. The final performance of these models is finally assessed using two criteria: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The primary objective of this research is to provide a scientifically-grounded prediction of future hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in the Canary Islands. Ultimately, the results of this study have the potential to contribute to better decision-making processes in the management of the pandemic, helping to mitigate its effects on public health and society as a whole.
